working code:
[python]
mot = explorerhat.motor.one
mot.speed([-100 - 100])


motor One:
GPIO ins: 19, 20
Board pins: 35, 38
var names: M1B, M1F

motor Two:
pins: 21, 26
Board pins: 40, 37
var names: M2B, M2F


controlled using pwm_bw.ChangeDutyCycle([pass speed])
pwm_bw is a GPIO.PWM object
GPIO.PWN is passed pin number and 100 [100 is the frequency]
